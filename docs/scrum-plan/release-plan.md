# Frontend Release Plan — Enterprise Commerce Platform (ECP)

**Document type:** Derived lane release plan · **Audience:** Frontend Engineering, Product Management
**Canonical source:** [PM release plan](../release-plan.md)

---

## Purpose

This view retains the canonical release order and all sprint positions, while focusing commitment detail on the frontend lane. Each sprint links to a filtered task backlog; cross-lane work remains a delivery milestone rather than a duplicate worklist.

The plan remains **36 two-week sprints across R1–R3**, with the Sprint 29 Must cut line and the three Integration Hardening sprints unchanged.

## Working Commitments

- Follow the [shared Scrum framework](../scrum-framework.md); the two-lane board and the Integrated column still apply.
- Use the [frontend product backlog](./product-backlog.md) for scheduled slices and [sprint backlogs](./sprint-backlogs/README.md) for task-level work.
- At every Contract Sync, verify the increment with the [shared integration checklist](../integration-plan.md#3-the-contract-sync-gate).
- During IH-1, IH-2, and IH-3, execute only the lane-owned verification checklist; do not pull forward story work.

## Canonical Detail

The [integrated release plan](../release-plan.md) remains authoritative for full two-lane point loads, sequencing rationale, capacity reserve, risks, and any conflict resolution.
